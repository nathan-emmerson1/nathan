    <strong><h1>My Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1></strong>
    <p><strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong></p>
     <p>My current long term goal at the moment would be trying to get my head around the Java script basic and trying to create solution for problems that i get, and also trying to become good at it. My carrer path i would still like to move into a job that users java Script often </p>

    <p><strong>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</strong></p>
    <p>My strengths with learning if i don't know something i won't be afraid to ask the teacher to explain it until i have my own understanding of what's being said, also some other streghts i have found utilizing the problem solving techniques we have learned like asking peers and using google. Some of my limitations would be i can over think tasks that need to be done. other litmitation i have come to  

  learng about myself during foundations , is my way to set up task for function and trying pull out parts that i need to do for a task , getting caught up in the wording of the task can be quite difficult. i can also get easly errated with myself when i functions not doing what it is suppose to do 

 </p>
    <p><strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</strong></p>
    <p>I think i am going to struggle with the work load of boot camp and trying to stay on top of my work without wanting to go over things and spend more time on it becuase that it 
    is how i am going to learn , but trying to fine time to fit it in will be up to me.Standing up presenting to people may also be difficult i am very shy person but it will be good for me 
    as i look at it from a growth mind perspective.at times with working with other people i may not want to contribute to the team because i lack the confidence to speak up , because i am afraid of being wrong</p>
    <p><strong>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong></p>
    <p>I still currenly want to work on my  develop interaction, communication and soft skills during bootcamp</p>
    <p><strong>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</strong></p>
    <p>My expections of my Bootcamp team, if i am stuck on something that i do not quite understand i would expact them to help me understand it , or trying to give other options of work that i could go over in my own time
    . I also expect to motivate me to become the best i can, also any jobs given to me i would hope they would try to explain to the best of there abilities what task need to be done. Also creating deadlines for us</p>
    <p><strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</strong></p>
    <p> all work that needs to done within the given time, I want to be kind to myself and remember that this is only the start.i expect myself to make good contribrition to the team. 
    i also expect myself to work really hard and also be fair to my team mates. i want to make sure i can help anybody that needs.ALso making sure that i am still doing my selfcare routines, and if i am behind on work speak up to the facilitators</p>
