<p><strong></strong></p> what are classes and ids atributes</h3>
<p>A class is a way to apply a style to multiple elements on a webpage without having to repeat the same style declaration for each element. You can assign the same class to multiple HTML elements, and they will all inherit the styles defined for that class in the CSS. 
An ID is used to uniquely identify a single element on a webpage. Unlike classes, which can be applied to multiple elements, an ID should only be used once per page because it is meant to identify a unique element.
</p>
<p><strong>Classes</strong></p>
<p><strong>how to use classes</strong></p> 
<p>To use classes in HTML and CSS, first, define a class in your CSS file using a dot (.) followed by the class name, and specify the styles within the curly braces {}. Then, in your HTML file, apply this class to an element using the class attribute followed by the class name. Multiple classes can be applied to a single element by separating them with spaces. </p>
<p>This example classes used in html and CSS</p>

<p>If you think of a hotel room and each hotel room has there own cook 
  and are given set menu or clases they have to make for there room(elements) but the other cooks can use there menu aswell </p> 
<p><strong>Id's</strong></p>
<p><strong>what are id?</strong></p>
<p>In HTML and CSS, an ID serves as a unique identifier for a specific element on a webpage. It allows you to apply targeted styles
 to a single, unique element. To define an ID in CSS, you use a hash (#) followed by the ID name, specifying the styles within curly braces {}. In the HTML, the ID is applied to an element using the id attribute. An ID should be unique within a page to ensure proper identification and styling of the intended element.

<p><strong>How to use Identifies</strong></p>
<p>To use an ID in HTML and CSS, first, define the ID in your CSS file using a hash (#) followed by the ID name, and specify the styles within the curly braces {}. Then, in your HTML file, apply this ID to a specific element using the id attribute followed by the ID name. It's crucial to remember that an ID should be unique within a page to correctly target and style the intended element.</p>

<p> so if we take our hotel and cooks analogy and apply to id. Cooks are given
  set menu(id) for there rooms(elements) but they can only use one menu for all rooms.
