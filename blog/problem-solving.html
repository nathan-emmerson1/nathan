        Have you ever played a game where you say certain words depending on a
        number you hear? The FizzBuzz challenge is like a fun coding game that
        involves numbers and special words!. Imagine you have a secret code with
        your friends. Instead of words, you use numbers. In this code, whenever
        a number is a multiple of 3, you say "Fizz." If the number is a multiple
        of 5, you say "Buzz." But it gets trickier! If a number is a multiple of
        both 3 and 5 (like 15, which is divisible by both 3 and 5), you need to
        say "FizzBuzz"!

        Now this where i had most problems was translating this into a computer
        function. We create a function called "fizzbuzz" that takes a number as
        input. When you input a number into this function, it checks if the
        number meets any of these criteria (divisible by 3, 5, or 15), and
        returns a specific word accordingly. For instance, if you input 3 into
        the function, since it's divisible by 3, the function will return
        "Fizz". If you input 5, it returns "Buzz". If you input 15, it returns
        "FizzBuzz" because it's divisible by both 3 and 5. If you input a number
        that doesn't meet any of these conditions, like 7, the function will
        simply return 7, as it's not divisible by 3, 5, or 15.

        To solve this problem using Google, you would typically start by
        searching for information on how to write a function in a programming
        language. You might search for something like "how to write a function
        in JavaScript" if you're using JavaScript, for example. Once you
        understand how to write a function, you would then search for how to
        check if a number is divisible by another number.Next, you would search
        for how to combine multiple conditions in programming. This would help
        you figure out how to check if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, or
        just by 3 or 5 individually. You might search for something like "how to
        combine conditions in an if statement in JavaScript".

        Your peer would start by explaining the problem to you in simple terms.
        They would make sure i understood what FizzBuzz means and what the
        function needs to do. Together, we would break down the problem into
        smaller, more manageable parts. My peer suggest starting with figuring
        out how to check if a number is divisible by 3, then move on to checking
        for divisibility by 5, and finally, checking for divisibility by both 3
        and 5. As i start writing code to solve the problem, my peer would
        encourage me to experiment and try different approaches. He would
        suggest running your code with different inputs to see how it behaves
        and help me understand why certain things work while others don't.Above
        all, my peer would provide encouragement and support, reassuring you
        that it's okay to make mistakes and that learning to code is a gradual
        process.

        when i was at a young age In the wild maze of algebra, I was totally
        lost, too scared to speak up during class. As the big test approached, I
        knew I was in trouble. But instead of giving up, I promised myself I'd
        start asking for help when I needed it. So, I swallowed my pride and
        talked to my teacher, who turned out to be super understanding and
        helpful. With their support and some study group fun, I started to get
        it. Algebra didn't seem so scary anymore. It was all about taking it
        step by step, asking questions, and never giving up.
