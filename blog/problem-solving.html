        Have you ever played a game where you say certain words depending on a
        number you hear? The FizzBuzz challenge is like a fun coding game that
        involves numbers and special words!. Imagine you have a secret code with
        your friends. Instead of words, you use numbers. In this code, whenever
        a number is a multiple of 3, you say "Fizz." If the number is a multiple
        of 5, you say "Buzz." But it gets trickier! If a number is a multiple of
        both 3 and 5 (like 15, which is divisible by both 3 and 5), you need to
        say "FizzBuzz"!

        Now this where i had most problems was translating this into a computer
        function. We create a function called "fizzbuzz" that takes a number as
        input. When you input a number into this function, it checks if the
        number meets any of these criteria (divisible by 3, 5, or 15), and
        returns a specific word accordingly. For instance, if you input 3 into
        the function, since it's divisible by 3, the function will return
        "Fizz". If you input 5, it returns "Buzz". If you input 15, it returns
        "FizzBuzz" because it's divisible by both 3 and 5. If you input a number
        that doesn't meet any of these conditions, like 7, the function will
        simply return 7, as it's not divisible by 3, 5, or 15.

      <p>
        To solve this problem using Google, you would typically start by
        searching for information on how to write a function in a programming
        language. You might search for something like "how to write a function
        in JavaScript" if you're using JavaScript, for example. Once you
        understand how to write a function, you would then search for how to
        check if a number is divisible by another number.Next, you would search
        for how to combine multiple conditions in programming. This would help
        you figure out how to check if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, or
        just by 3 or 5 individually. You might search for something like "how to
        combine conditions in an if statement in JavaScript".

        My peer would start by explaining the problem to you in simple terms.
        They would make sure i understood what FizzBuzz means and what the
        function needs to do. Together, we would break down the problem into
        smaller, more manageable parts. My peer suggest starting with figuring
        out how to check if a number is divisible by 3, then move on to checking
        for divisibility by 5, and finally, checking for divisibility by both 3
        and 5. As i start writing code to solve the problem, my peer would
        encourage me to experiment and try different approaches. He would
        suggest running your code with different inputs to see how it behaves
        and help me understand why certain things work while others don't.Above
        all, my peer would provide encouragement and support, reassuring me that
        it's okay to make mistakes and that learning to code is a gradual
        process.

      <strong><p>Techniques and Confidence</p></strong>
      <strong><p>Pseudocode</p></strong>
      <p>
        This techniques has been helpful for me , it helps break down bigger
        problems into smaller step step task to get the accomplishments of one
        big task , i would say i need more work on this but that is to the code
        side of things
      </p>
      <strong><p>Trying something</p></strong>
      <p>
        Trying something is quite difficult because i lack the confidence in
        myself to step outside the boundaries at times,but will get confident at
        doing this over time
      </p>
      <strong><p>Rubber ducky method</p></strong>
      <p>
        I have used the rubber ducky method before when i was in school but
        normally use it while playing chess. i have used it sometime during the
        exercise but i still not very confident at useing Javascript so tryna
        talk myself throw the problem is hole different ball game
      </p>
      <strong><p>Reading error messages</p></strong>
      <p>
        Error messeges can be helpful sometimes but when i dont really
        understand them can be very difficult , i am very confident at useing
        this techniques
      </p>
      <strong><p>Console.logging</p></strong>
      <p>
        Ive found console.logging quite helpful so far on journey with
        JavaScript it allow you to see the function in action and break it down
        from there. i very confident at useing this but will need more practise
      </p>
      <strong><p>Googling</p></strong>
      <p>
        Googling is definately one of my go too for solving problems. But i use
        google for anything to help me researh topics. i can say i am confident
        at useing this techniques
      </p>
      <strong><p>Asking your peers for help</p></strong>
      <p>
        This is has been helpful on my journey throw Java Script , i have a few
        boys where i am studying who have been helping me understand and break
        down things more better so i can soak it in
      </p>
      <strong><p>Asking coaches for help</p></strong>
      <p>
        I havent really been useing the coaches very much ,ive got the boys who
        are here to help , but any questions that i really need to ask i will
        use the chanels
      </p>
      <strong><p>Improving your process with reflection</p></strong>
      <p>
        I am quite new to reflecting on learning , ive done reflecting on my
        life and behaviors. but sometimes i need to just practice more and more
        of the same difficult challenge, to help make it stick with me
      </p>

      <p><strong>A time stuggle to seek help</strong></p>

        when i was at a young age in algebra, I was totally lost, too scared to
        speak up during class. As the big test approached, I knew I was in
        trouble. But instead of giving up, I promised myself I'd start asking
        for help when I needed it. So, I swallowed my pride and talked to my
        teacher, who turned out to be super understanding and helpful. With
        their support and some study group fun, I started to get it. Algebra
        didn't seem so scary anymore. It was all about taking it step by step,
        asking questions, and never giving up.
