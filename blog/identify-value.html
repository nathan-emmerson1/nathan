<h1>This is blog about my Values</h1>
<h2>I hope you enjoy</h2>
<strong><p>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.  </p> </strong>
<p>As a student of the Te Aute College, bullying was a big part of our culture as a border. Once i became senior, i made sure that they're was going to be no more of that. Me and my peers tried to create this new move of breaking the cycle for the future of our junior students </p>
<strong><p>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity. </p></strong>
<p>My culture as man was always to provided, protect  your family. The people i grew up around showed me that you must go to work everyday and work hard  
</p>
<strong><p>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey. </p></strong>
<p>My strength is fairness i think this is going to help with working with others supporting there ideas , and come from a understanding point of view.  </p>
<strong><p>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey? </p></strong>
<p>I can sometime be lazy but i think that human nature I lack the courage to say something or to share ideas with people, i can get easily distracted with following content or get confused at times  </p>
<strong><p>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why </p></strong>
<p>Me and my team members were a three day pack march with no sleep , as we were all getting frustrated with each other because someone was taking to long to march, i decided to put him at the front so that he can set the paste for us all. Plus we added in more breaks so everyone could get some rest. This increases the moral of my peers </p>
