        >What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      During the core exercise i have learned a lot about myself not just with
      the journey and path that I am on now, but with my pass experiences prior.
      Learning about emotion intelligence has help me open my eyes on how to
      gain this with putting in daily practice of mindfulness allow this space
      in my routine to help get me a step closer to a peace of mind with
      clarity. I understand my mind can be full of negative thought of myself
      with my current journey a lot of comparing myself to other and putting
      pressure on myself that should be able to do that same as them. It was
      also great to learn about the neuroplasticity that i have been engaging
      with some of the ways to increase my neuroplasticity with Exerciese and
      good sleep routine.

        >What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
        and programming?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Values</strong></p>
    <p>
      Guidance in Decision Making: Values provide a moral compass that guides
      individuals in making ethical and responsible decisions, both in learning
      and programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Motivation: Personal values can serve as a motivational factor, driving
      learners and programmers to pursue their goals and projects with passion
      and dedication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collaboration and Teamwork: Shared values within a learning or programming
      team can foster collaboration, cohesion, and effective communication among
      members.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Empathy</strong></p>
    <p>
      Understanding User Needs: Empathy allows programmers to better understand
      the needs and perspectives of end-users, leading to the development of
      more user-friendly and effective software.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effective Communication: Empathy enhances communication skills,
      facilitating clearer and more empathetic interactions between team members
      in a learning or programming environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feedback Reception: Empathy helps learners and programmers to receive
      feedback more positively and constructively, facilitating personal and
      professional growth.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Self-Awareness</strong></p>
    <p>Identifying Strengths and Weaknesses: 

Self-awareness allows learners and programmers to recognize their strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to focus on areas that require improvement and leverage their strengths effectively.</p>
<p>Adaptability and Flexibility: 

Being self-aware enables individuals to adapt to new learning methods or programming languages more easily, as they are aware of their learning preferences and can adjust their approaches accordingly. </p>
<p>Emotional Regulation: 

Self-awareness helps individuals to manage their emotions effectively, enabling them to remain focused, calm, and productive in high-pressure learning and programming situations. </p>
<p>Continuous Learning and Growth: 

Self-aware individuals are more likely to engage in continuous learning and seek opportunities for professional development, enhancing their skills and knowledge in the field of programming. </p>

      <strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning? </strong>
    </p>
    <p>Learning about the Growth mindset , and what people can accomplish just by adapting this mindset. And how we look at challenges for chance for us to grow. Also a way for me to start living this way, Learning about feed back , setting meaningful goals for myself and Embrace challenges. </p>
      <strong
        >What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>The most challenging part for me was finding time to fit my mindfulness in with my routine with all my other commitments and making sure i commit to this. Also trying to integrate the growth mindset and applying these on my learning journey. </p>

      <strong
        >Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>Because it can we good way to help people who may be struggling on this course, to open up there mind to different ways they can look at the learning journey that they have chosen. And to also help us learn about self , give us other tools of self-care that we may need in the  future. </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
        of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>No not for me i feel it's a great thing to learn about these core learning that the course has provided to us, because for me i am glad to  be trying to integrate some healthy habits to boost my productivity in the long run. I feel like regardless i was going to struggle with the programing side of things but that's all part of the growth mindset, and it would be up to me to try to fit in some extra time of learning in my own time and thast completely fine.  </p>
