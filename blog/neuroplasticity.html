      <p><strong>Benefits of Neuroplasticity Priciples</strong></p>
      <p>
        The benefits of using the principles of neuroplasticity you will be able
        to learn new things much quicker but you must first but in that first
        practice of the new thing you want to learn. It can enhance existing
        cognitive capabilities like thinking, learning, reading, remembering,
        and speaking.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Here a few principles</strong></p>
      <ul class="myul">
        <li>
          Use it or lose it – Neural connections lose strength when they are not
          being used
        </li>
        <li>
          Use it and improve it – Neural pathways grow stronger the more they
          are used
        </li>
        <li>
          Time matters – It takes varying amounts of time for the brain to
          change depending on how complex or foreign the new behavior or skill
          is to you
        </li>
        <li>
          Repetition matters – Consistency is the key to building new synapses
          and solidifying new skills
        </li>
        <li>
          Intensity matters – Neuroplastic changes result from incremental
          progressive challenges to elicit a positive growth response
        </li>
      </ul>

        a set time where I will practice daily

      <h1><strong>Growth Mindset</strong></h1>
      <p><strong>What is Growth Mindset</strong></p>
      <p>
        Growth mindset describes a way of viewing challenges and setbacks.
        People who have a growth mindset believe that even if they struggle with
        certain skills, their abilities aren’t set in stone. They think that
        with work, their skills can improve over time. People with the opposite
        belief, that abilities are what they are and won’t change have a fixed
        mindset. They think their skills won’t improve no matter how hard they
        try.
      </p>
      <p><strong>What changed for me </strong></p>
      <p>
        I would say it changed my view on challenges and struggles that i have
        had in my life that i can use as pass experiences . To tell myself that
        i can do this but its going to take time and hard work.
