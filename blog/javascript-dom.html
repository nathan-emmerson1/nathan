      <strong><h1>Java Script,HTML,CSS</h1></strong>
      <p>
        What relationship does Java Script have with HTML and CSS. So HTML
        creates and structures the website’s content, CSS adds style and
        formatting to these structures, and then JavaScript turns those stylized
        components into something that a user can interact with. Say you want to
        build a website where users can fill out a form for a contest, HTML will
        allow you to designate the difference between the text that announces
        the contest and the text that asks questions within the form such as a
        participant’s name, age, address, CSS will allow you to dress all this
        text up, giving it formatting, color, and style while helping you build
        the boxes where users will input their answers JavaScript will then
        enable you to program a little box that pops up and says “Thanks for
        entering!” when everything has been filled out and submitted

      <strong>Control Flow and Loops</strong>
      <strong>What is Control Flow</strong>
      <p>
        Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a
        script. Code is run in order from the first line at the top of a script
        to the last unless the computer comes across structures that change the
        control flow ,and those are conditionals (which may skip code) or loops
        (which may loop a particular code over and over until completed)
      </p>
      <p>
        Let say the night before your day starts youve plan your baby night
        routine and how your gonna execute it ie he/she needs to be in the
        shower by 6 45 ,washed and out of the shower by 7 , dried ,dressed by 7
        15 , ect ect. This is the flow of your baby night routine, and control
        would be by the end of the 15 minute window that task is going to be
        completed and instanly move on to the next. But if i am baby feet are
        still dirty were gonna have to keep washing her feet till there clean,
        this would be our loop

      <strong>Describe the DOM</strong>
      <p>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web
        documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the
        document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document
        as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with
        the page.The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the
        JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML
        documents, SVG documents, and their component parts.

      <strong>Difference between Arrays and Objects</strong>
      <strong>Arrays</strong>
      <p>
        An array is an arrangement of numbers, pictures or objects formatted
        into rows and columns according to their type. In coding and
        programming, an array is a collection of items, or data, stored in
        contiguous memory locations, also known as database systems. The purpose
        of an array is to store multiple pieces of data of the same type
        together
